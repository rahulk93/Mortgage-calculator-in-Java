This repository is about Mortgage calculator in Java programming language. This application has the ability to store users' inputs such as principal, annual interest 
rate and period (years) and utilize an equation to calculate monthly mortgage payments.   

A user can enter principle, annual interest rate and period (years). When a user is entering annual interest rate, the input is divided by 100 and then by 12. 100 
represents percentage while 12 represents total number of months in a year. When a user is entering period (years), the input is multiplied by 12 which represents 
total number of months in a year.

**What I learnt while making this application above:** In this programme, I learnt how to make arithmetic expressions, order of operations, casting, the math class, 
formatting numbers and reading input. The programme can comprehend input entered by user. I studied how numbers can be formatted when receiving output. 

**How might I improve:** Adding more comments around the code to show my understanding.
